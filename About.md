# About Me

I'm an ardent politics buff, disgruntled movie fanatic, frustrated lover of literature, die-hard quizzer, and the occasional teacher. Presently, I'm a PhD Research Fellow at Gauhati University. My areas of specialisation are Displacement Narratives, Exile Literature, and Diaspora. I am also working as a Guest Faculty in B. Borooah College, Guwahati.


## Blog

Although I enjoy writing, at present I hardly get any time to do so. Burdened with research, academic assignments and work, the art within me is slowly fading. I am almost always in class- either taking one as a teacher or sitting in one as a student. Still at some rare occasions, whenever possible, I pen down my thoughts.

## A Year in Books

Everyone who has spent some time with me knows how important books are to me and what an impact they have had — and continue to have — on my life. 
2018 was a great year for reading. I challenged myself to read at least 50 books. From cover to cover, I successfully finished reading 37 books (this list does not include books that I read as a part of my academic/work assignment). Continuing the same thread, I really look forward to read at least 50 books this year (that's roughly 4 books a month). One book series that I would like to finally finish reading is A Song of Ice and Fire. You can find the list of books (along with a swanky review) here.
